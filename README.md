MS CMPE 255 Final Project
Project Abstract

Project Title: Use historical data to predict future electricity usage.
Dataset:
The Dataset has been taken from UC, Irvine. The link to access the dataset is given below.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption
About Dataset:
1. This dataset provides comprehensive data on electric power usage in a single household,
sampled every minute for nearly 4 years. It encompasses different electrical metrics and
has sub-metering readings to shed light on the consumption of individual devices.
2. The information is probably gathered through advanced metering systems that track and
document electric usage consistently.
3. The dataset comprises 2,075,259 entries spread across 9 columns.
Purpose of the project:
To develop a predictive model that forecasts household electric power consumption, enabling
homeowners and utility providers to optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and make informed
decisions about energy consumption patterns and sustainability. Additionally, by identifying
anomalies and consumption patterns, the project aims to provide insights into device-specific
usage and overall household behavior related to energy consumption.
Proposed Methodology and Techniques to be used:
1. Preprocess Data: Handle missing values and standardize measurements.
2. Feature Engineering: Extract time-related attributes and determine feature significance.
3. Time-Series Forecasting: Use past records to predict future electricity usage.
4. Modeling: Employ algorithms like Random Forest, and LSTM for predictions.
5. Evaluation: Compare model forecasts with actual data and visualize the results.
6. Advanced Analysis: Detect anomalies and cluster similar consumption patterns.
